# C Plus Plus Programming
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

1. First released in 1985
2. Most used for Competitive programming and among college students
3. Software Development and OS
4. Low level and system level programming
5. Speed of Execution
6. Allows Hardware access through pointers and references
7. Allows us to do OOP too
8. C is subset of C++
9. Generic Programming - Write once, use at many places
10. Exception handling too
11. STL is very useful which implements standard DS and Algos
12. Other libraries like Game Dev and Boost are available
13. Browsers like chrome written in C++
14. Device drivers too
15. Java and python used lot more in industry compared to C++ but that doesnt take anything away from C++

  
## Standards and Implementations
- First Standardized in 1998 (C++98)
- C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20 etc.,
- What are rules? Every programming has rules which says what is allowed and what is not
  - Example of rule is BODMAS implementation in C++
- Compiler verifies rules
- Compilers available for C++ is g++, Visual Studio, IBM etc.,
- Third party compilers can provide additional features too like gcc provides gcd() to calculate GCD
- C++ may sometimes have undefined outputs which are compiler dependent. Dont write likethat

## Basic Programming Terminologies
1. Functions - A sequence of instructions that does a specific job
2. Object Oriented Programming - Instead of functions calling each other, in oop, we create objects that interact with each other.
3. Class - Blueprint: contains functionality, information and operations
4. Object - Instance of Class
5. Data and functions constitute class
6. C++ programming lang supports both functional and oop
7. Java and C++ support primitive class and userdefined class along with builtin classes
8. Statically typed: C++, Java -> We declare variables before using them
9. Dynamically typed: Python -> No need
10. But Statically typed is faster than dynamically typed - Reason is obvious
11. Header Files: Statically typed language right? Header files contain declarations and all other things in headerfiles. example is iostream which conrtains declarations of input and output
12. Namespace: Used to create multiple logical groups in large code. Code is divided into logical groups, helps in avoiding name collision


## How do C++ Programs Run?

- We write code in editor.
